# Lab Description:

This application uses two switches and two LEDs. One LED is a 'red LED' and the other
is an RGB LED. When switch 'one' is clicked the selected LED changes state (on/off
in the case of the red LED). When switch 'two' is clicked we switch to another LED
to be 'selected'. This program's default is to have the red LED selected, and for 
the red LED to be in the off state. By clicking switch two, we can select the RGB
LED; following that, clicking switch one repeatedly will change the state of the RGB
LED such that it's color changes from one color to the next.
